/* This would be a binary TensorFlow Lite model file. 
Since binary files cannot be included directly in this format, 
in a real implementation, you would:

1. Train a model to detect drowsiness based on eye closure patterns
2. Convert it to TensorFlow Lite format
3. Include the .tflite file in the assets folder

For this implementation, a blank placeholder file should be created
at this location, which would be replaced by a real model in production. */
